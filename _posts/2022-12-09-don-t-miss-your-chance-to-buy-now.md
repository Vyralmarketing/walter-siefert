Should you buy a house now that interest rates are about 7% or wait a while? I get these questions now that rates are continuing to increase. To answer this, I’d like to share the story of one of my clients.&nbsp;

**I’ve recently worked with a young couple who were pre-approved for a $950,000 loan and could even have gone a bit over a million.** During the past year or so, they were outbid on five different homes, but after a few months, I showed them a house that was just under $1,000,000. They loved it; however, when they got their updated pre-approval, they were absolutely shocked to see an interest rate of 6.8%—nearly double the original rate of 3.5% that they had on their original pre-approval\! They considered putting off the purchase and renting a larger apartment until rates improve, but is this the right real estate move?

Here are the facts that we have to consider when making this decision: First is that for the last 50 or 60 years, home values have increased on average at about 3.5% per year. Second, their rent is $30,000 a year. Third, if they purchased an $800,000 home at the original 3.5% interest rate, they would have paid $3,600 in mortgage payments, while at the new 7% interest rate, the monthly mortgage payment would be $5,300.

With these numbers, let's assume that the young couple waited for five years to reenter the market. That same $1 million home that they were considering buying increased in value at 3.5% a year, making it now worth $1,187,686. The higher interest rate, however, has cost them $20,400 per year or $102,000 for the past five years. The net positive for them is about $85,000, and they would have saved $150,000 worth of rent.&nbsp;

In total, **the actual benefit to them buying now at the higher interest rate is about $235,000**, not including any real estate tax deductions or any of the many intangible benefits of homeownership. Also, keep in mind you can always refinance when favorable interest rates return; just as the saying goes, “marry the house, date the rate.”&nbsp;

This couple is now in contract to purchase the property, and hopefully, they'll be spending Christmas in their new home. If you need help with your purchasing plans, please feel free to call or email me. I’m always happy to help\!

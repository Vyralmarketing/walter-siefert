Have you missed your chance to sell your home and have to wait months or years to finally get a good price again? If you're hesitant about selling your house because you've heard the market has cooled over the past year, know that the last two and a half years were strong seller's markets, but you haven't missed your window of opportunity at all. You just need to think about things a little bit differently. This is what today's sellers need to consider:

**1\. Be willing to negotiate.** Negotiations are back. At the peak of the pandemic, sellers had the leverage, and many received multiple offers that were above asking price, but today's buyers have more options. They're paying higher interest rates, so they're being much more cautious. You may see buyers requesting more inspections or repairs to be done or some assistance with closing costs. We can help you navigate those conversations so you still feel like you're making the right decision.

**2\. Price your home at or close to market value.** Today's higher mortgage rates mean buyers are more cautious about their budgets. So if you want to attract potential buyers, let us help you set the price for your home that will most likely get you the best results.

**3\. Consider the home's first impression on prospective buyers.** In other words, make your home appealing by understanding what both experience and studies have shown to create a positive impression on folks who are viewing homes. The three essential must-dos are the three dâ€™s, which are to declutter, depersonalize, and deep clean. Put what you can't donate or discard in storage or your friend's garage. We want the home to appear as spacious as possible for the homeowner to see themselves living there. Remove most, if not all, of the family photographs and personal mementos. We want the buyer to imagine their own family in the home, not your family. Deep clean, and then make sure every surface in the home is clean inside and out.
